## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jedi132000/probepilot.git
cd probepilot

# Start with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Access ProbePilot Mission Control
open http://localhost:7860
```

### Option 2: Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jedi132000/probepilot.git
cd probepilot

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
pip install -r frontend/requirements.txt

# Start the backend (FastAPI with advanced analytics)
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000 &

# Start the frontend (Gradio mission control)
cd ../frontend
python app.py

# Access ProbePilot Mission Control
open http://localhost:7860
```

### System Requirements
- **Python 3.8+** with psutil, scipy, scikit-learn, pandas, plotly
- **FastAPI** for backend API services
- **Gradio** for interactive dashboard interface
- **SQLite** for historical metrics storage
- **Real system access** for hardware metrics collection

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+** (for local development)
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (for containerized setup)
- **Linux kernel 4.4+** (for eBPF support)

See [Development Setup Guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for detailed instructions.
