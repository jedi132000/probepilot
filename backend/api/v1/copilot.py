4. **Memory Usage Monitor** - Resource utilization tracking

**Deployment Strategy:**
- Start with network and CPU probes for baseline visibility
- Add application-specific probes based on your stack
- Configure appropriate sampling rates to minimize overhead

**Best Practices:**
- Begin with 1% sampling rate for low impact
- Deploy probes during low-traffic periods
